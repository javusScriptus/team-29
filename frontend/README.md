## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Coding Guidlines

We are using eslint and prettier
Every variable and component will need to start with an Upper Case letter.
The pages are exported as default, the function componenets are exported as const
The web app components are stored in the frontend/src/ folder; all compoments are stored in frontend/src/components, all route pages are stored in frontend/src/pages
